<tt>http://bitflash.herokuapp.com/</tt>

With most remittance companies and apps, you must pay an arm and a leg to transfer money to your friends, family, and acquaintance. Usually you will be charged a percentage of the transaction amount, or a flat fee.  With Bitcoin, we eliminate the middleman that other applications need to include in their costs, making transfers almost free.

## Features
- Add friends to your friends list.
- Send bitcoin with the click of a button.

## Ease of use
Usually, when you are using a Bitcoin application, to send a payment you need to either scan a QR code or copy and paste that long, impossible to remember btc address.
BitFlash was created to eliminate the need to go through this annoying process. With Bitflash, you never need to worry about what your friends' Bitcoin addresses are.  If you add someone to your friends list, you can send money to them merely by entering the amount and confirming.
